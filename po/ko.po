"In 2020, StarkWare released Cairo 0, a Turing-complete programming language "
"supporting verifiable computation. Cairo started as an assembly language and "
"gradually became more expressive. The learning curve was initially steep, as "
"Cairo 0.x was a low-level language that did not entirely abstract the "
"underlying cryptographic primitives required to build a proof for the "
"execution of a program."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-01-foreword.md
msgid ""
"With the release of Cairo 1, the developer experience has considerably "
"improved, abstracting away the underlying immutable memory model of the "
"Cairo architecture where possible. Strongly inspired by Rust, Cairo 1 has "
"been built to help you create provable programs without specific knowledge "
"of its underlying architecture so that you can focus on the program itself, "
"increasing the overall security of Cairo programs. Powered by a Rust VM, the "
"execution of Cairo programs is now _blazingly_ fast, allowing you to build "
"an extensive test suite without compromising on performance."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-01-foreword.md
msgid ""
"Blockchain developers that want to deploy contracts on Starknet will use the "
"Cairo programming language to code their smart contracts. This allows the "
"Starknet OS to generate execution traces for transactions to be proved by a "
"prover, which is then verified on Ethereum L1 prior to updating the state "
"root of Starknet."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-01-foreword.md
msgid ""
"However, Cairo is not only for blockchain developers. As a general purpose "
"programming language, it can be used for any computation that would benefit "
"from being proved on one computer and verified on other machines with lower "
"hardware requirements."

#: src/ch00-01-foreword.md

msgid "What is Cairo?"
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-00-introduction.md
msgid ""
"Cairo is a programming language designed for a virtual CPU of the same name. "
"The unique aspect of this processor is that it was not created for the "
"physical constraints of our world but for cryptographic ones, making it "
"capable of efficiently proving the execution of any program running on it. "
"This means that you can perform time consuming operations on a machine you "
"don't trust, and check the result very quickly on a cheaper machine. While "
"Cairo 0 used to be directly compiled to CASM, the Cairo CPU assembly, Cairo "
"1 is a higher level language. It first compiles to Sierra, an intermediate "
"representation of Cairo which will compile later down to a safe subset of "
"CASM. The point of Sierra is to ensure your CASM will always be provable, "
"even when the computation fails."
msgstr ""

msgid "What Can you Do with It?"
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-00-introduction.md
msgid ""
"Cairo allows you to compute trustworthy values on untrusted machines. One "
"major usecase is Starknet, a solution to Ethereum scaling. Ethereum is a "
"decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of decentralized "
"applications where every single interaction between a user and a d-app is "
"verified by all the participants. Starknet is a Layer 2 built on top of "
"Ethereum. Instead of having all the participants of the network to verify "
"all user interactions, only one node, called the prover, executes the "
"programs and generates proofs that the computations were done correctly. "
"These proofs are then verified by an Ethereum smart contract, requiring "
"significantly less computational power compared to executing the "
"interactions themselves. This approach allows for increased throughput and "
"reduced transaction costs while preserving Ethereum security."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-00-introduction.md
msgid "What Are the Differences with Other Programming Languages?"
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-00-introduction.md
msgid ""
"Cairo is quite different from traditional programming languages, especially "
"when it comes to overhead costs and its primary advantages. Your program can "
"be executed in two different ways:"
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-00-introduction.md
msgid ""
"When executed by the prover, it is similar to any other language. Because "
"Cairo is virtualized, and because the operations were not specifically "
"designed for maximum efficiency, this can lead to some performance overhead "
"but it is not the most relevant part to optimize."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-00-introduction.md
msgid ""
"When the generated proof is verified by a verifier, it is a bit different. "
"This has to be as cheap as possible since it could potentially be verified "
"on many very small machines. Fortunately verifying is faster than computing "
"and Cairo has some unique advantages to improve it even more. A notable one "
"is non-determinism. This is a topic you will cover in more detail later in "
"this book, but the idea is that you can theoretically use a different "
"algorithm for verifying than for computing. Currently, writing custom non-"
"deterministic code is not supported for the developers, but the standard "
"library leverages non-determinism for improved performance. For example "
"sorting an array in Cairo costs the same price as copying it. Because the "
"verifier doesn't sort the array, it just checks that it is sorted, which is "
"cheaper."
msgstr ""

#: src/ch00-00-introduction.md
msgid ""
"Another aspect that sets the language apart is its memory model. In Cairo, "
"memory access is immutable, meaning that once a value is written to memory, "
"it cannot be changed. Cairo 1 provides abstractions that help developers "
"work with these constraints, but it does not fully simulate mutability. "
"Therefore, developers must think carefully about how they manage memory and "
"data structures in their programs to optimize performance."

"At its essence, hashing is a process of converting input data (often called "
"a message) of any length into a fixed-size value, typically referred to as a "
"\"hash.\" This transformation is deterministic, meaning that the same input "
"will always produce the same hash value. Hash functions are a fundamental "
"component in various fields, including data storage, cryptography and data "
"integrity verification. They are very often used when developing smart "
"contracts, especially when working with [Merkle trees](https://en.wikipedia."

"Pedersen hash functions are cryptographic algorithms that rely on [elliptic "

"elliptic curve — essentially, doing math with the locations of these points "
"— which are easy to do in one direction and hard to undo. This one-way "
"difficulty is based on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem "
"(ECDLP), which is a problem so hard to solve that it ensures the security of "
"the hash function. The difficulty of reversing these operations is what "
